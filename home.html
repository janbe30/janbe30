                        <div>
                            <p><strong>Problem statement:</strong> The Onboarding team needed a new way to manage equipment and access requests for new hires, as one of the company's main platforms - SharePoint - was being upgraded and the current method would no longer be compatible.</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Intake system to manage these requests leveraging different features of the new platform. I had the opportunity to learn a couple of new technologies along the way, such as the SharePoint Framework and TypeScript, and used them to create the current system which is used by hundreds of hiring managers.</p>

                            <p><strong>Problem statement:</strong> The teams responsible for the daily publishing of the intranet news site needed some additional tools to review the content and create the markup for the articles quickly. </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Two simple interactive tools to simplify the process for the teams involved. The content review tool ensures the content meets established guidelines and the content editor tool facilitates the creation of articles for both tech-savvy and non-tech savvy users alike.</p>

                            <p><strong>Problem statement:</strong> There was a need for provide new hires additional guidance and the ability to keep track of main tasks to complete during their first month with the company.</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Interactive checklist allows users to check tasks off as they complete them. It's responsive and very simple to use. The interactive checklist can be accessed from any internal device; if the user logs in from an external device then a static version of the checklist is displayed. </p>

                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A fresh, dynamic and mobile-first experience perfectly captured the strides made by the company delighting users along the way. The report was released publicly for the first time in seven years. </p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I have been in tech in one way or another, for about 13 years. From desktop support to software engineer. But my love for computers and technology goes way back to my childhood years. I guess you could say it all started in 1998 when I got my first computer - an Acer desktop with Windows 1998 and dial-up connection. Yup, I’ve always been a computer nerd 8-)</p>
                <p>I’m originally from Mexico. Juarez, Chihuahua to be exact. I went to college in Las Cruces, New Mexico and moved to Louisville, KY after graduating where I landed my first “real” job. After living there for two years, my girlfriend (now wife) and I decided to move to a warmer climate and landed in Austin, Tx., where we live with our two pups, Tobey and Tilley.</p>
                <p>When not building web things, I enjoy spending time with my partner and dogs, our friends and family. Some of my favorite things are traveling, hiking, watching movies, reading and discovering new places to eat.</p>
